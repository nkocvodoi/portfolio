# Recon map: vanhuy.dev + portfolio.vanhuy.dev

Clean-room: this map records layout and UX patterns only. No code, copy,
photos, logo or quotes from the original go into the clone. Reference
screenshots were viewed in the browser on 2026-10-27 and are not kept in the
repo.

## Scope

- **App, platform:** a developer's personal site, web (desktop + phone).
- **Slice:** the home page (hero + list under it), the projects grid, the
  about page, and the one-page portfolio. Blog posts, tags and search are out:
  the owner has no posts yet.
- **For:** Kiên Duy (GitHub `nkocvodoi`), to show three live projects:
  Bronze Dawn, Cocain, Sòng Phẳng. Vietnamese first, English and Japanese.
